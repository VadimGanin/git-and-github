    <h2>About Git and GitHub</h2>

    <br><h3>Git</h3>
    <p><span class="git" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>Git</strong></span> is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).</p>

    <br><h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p><span class="github" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>GitHub</strong></span> is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

        It is commonly used to host open-source projects. As of June 2022, GitHub reports having over 83 million developers and more than 200 million repositories (including at least 28 million public repositories). It is the largest source code host as of November 2021.</p>
